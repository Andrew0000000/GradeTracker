# GradeTracker

A web app that calculates a student's average grades. 

In the dashboard, all the student's modules will be displayed along with their marks for their coursework and exams. 

The student can click the button to add modules where they will be prompted to input the module name and code. They are also able to click the button to add coursework for a module, where they will be prompted to input the coursework name and its marks.

In the side panel, there is a chart page that displays a bar chart with the average marks for each module. There is also an exercises page that contains exercises for different courses and topics.
